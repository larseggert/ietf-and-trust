1.  Introduction

   The IETF Trust [TRUST] was created on December 15, 2005.  The
   purposes of the Trust is to acquire, hold, maintain and license
   existing and future intellectual property (IPR) and other property
   used in connection with the Internet standards process and the IETF.
   The Second Amended and Restated Trust Agreement [TAV2] is the
   revision of the original founding document currently in effect.

2.  RFCs about the IETF Trust

   This section gives a brief overview of the various current RFCs that
   make statements about the Trust.

   *  [RFC9281], aka BCP11, describes the role of the Trust in the
      context of other entities involved in the IETF standards process.

   *  [RFC9280] defines the role of the Trust in Version 3 of the RFC
      Editor Model.

   *  [RFC8722] defines that the Trust holds - on behalf of the IETF -
      any intellectual property rights of IETF protocol parameter
      assignment information, including the registry and its contents,
      and all registry publications.

   *  [RFC8721] describes the desires of the IETF regarding outbound
      rights to be granted in IETF Contributions.

   *  [RFC8714] updates the process for selection of Trustees for the
      IETF Trust under Version 2 of the IETF Administrative Support
      Activity (IASA) [RFC8711]; [RFC8717] updates the related IETF
      terminology.  Together, these three RFCs form BCP101.  [RFC8715]
      captures the rationale for the changes introduced in [RFC8714].

   *  [RFC8713], a part of BCP10, defines the selection, confirmation,
      and recall process of IETF nominating and recall committees,
      including for Trustees.

   *  [RFC8712] describes the IETF-ISOC relationship and reiterates that
      ISOC selects one of the Trustees.

   *  [RFC8179], aka BCP79, sets out the IETF policies concerning IPR
      related to technology worked on within the IETF.

   *  [RFC8090] outlines the procedures by which the IETF makes
      appointments to the Community Coordination Group (CCG), which
      provides advice and guidance to the IETF Trust in matters related
      to the IANA trademarks and the IANA domain names.

   *  [RFC5745], [RFC5744][RFC4846] and [RFC5743] clarify that the Trust
      also manages the copyrights associated with RFCs published on the
      IAB, Independent and IRTF RFC streams.

   *  [RFC5485] that the Trust logically owns the hardware security
      module holding the keys used to provide IETF Secretariat signature
      for Internet-Drafts.

   *  [RFC5378], aka BCP78, is the key document that details which
      rights IETF contributors provide to the Trust.

   There are numerous other RFCs that mention the Trust in passing,
   reiterating various aspects of its purpose, process or operation.
   Yet others are older RFCs that have been obsoleted by the ones
   mentioned above.

3.  Security Considerations

   The usual security considerations [RFC3552] do not apply to this
   document.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any IANA actions.
